## Why <header> but not <div> ?

    The <div> has no meaning. While, when using <header>, we tell the search engines that this is the header of our page

## The <figure> element ?

    It works like a container, containing an image and also the caption of that image

## When use <span> ?

    When we want to style some part of text in an element

## BEM ?

    It means 'Block Element Modified' --> use as a standard to name HTML classes
